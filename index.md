Focusing on biomedical data science and integrative multiomics, we have been devising and leveraging
advanced methods to aid deeper understanding of tumor micro-environment and stratification of patient subtypes
for precision medicine.

With years of efforts, we have curated several high quality datasets consists of multi-modality of image and tabular data. 
We developed many tools to quantify tissue micro-anatomy, cell morphology, proteomics, transcriptomics 
and gene profiles of cancer cohorts to advance the understanding tumor development, metastasis and treatment response.
