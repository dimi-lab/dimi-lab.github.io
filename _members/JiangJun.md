Dr. Jiang Jun joined Mayo Clinic in 2018 as a visiting research fellow in Dr. Hongfang Liuâ€™s program, specializing in AI modeling and biomedical imaging processing. 
As he developed research interests in digital pathology and molecular mechanisms, Dr. Jiang joined Department of Quantitative Health Sciences as a research fellow in 2022 to conduct digital pathology and multi-omics research. 
With hands-on experience in AI modeling, he has developed and published several deep-learning (DL) models for characterizing complex morphology and tissue patterns for ovarian tumors.  
Dr. Jiang is a key AI expert in several ongoing research projects, including an Ovarian SPORE pilot project and an externally funded DOE-NCI multiomics DL study. 
His current research focuses on deciphering spatial patterns of tumor micro-environments and building predictive DL/AI models using multiomics data modalities.
